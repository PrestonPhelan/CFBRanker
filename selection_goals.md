## List of possible selection goals
  * Best team
    * Best expected performance in an upcoming game
      * More focused on expected point spread
    * Best expected performance over an arbitrarily large number of games
      * Consistency matters
  * Most deserving
    * Must decide on target profile - i.e., resume most resembles #1, or resume most resembles top 4, etc.
    * Generic SOR - requires estimate of underlying distribution, gives an estimate of team strength based ONLY on W/L and opponent
      * Weighted Average
      * Max Likelihood Estimator
    * Probability of Record given target projection
      * Requires underlying distribution in order to estimate strength of a rank X team
      * P(worse) - % of rank X teams that would have a worse record than the team
      * P(mid) - % of rank X teams w/worse record + 0.5 * % of rank X teams w/same record
        * This metric does NOT handle mediocre undefeated records well
